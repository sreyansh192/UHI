	<h1>URBAN HEAT ISLAND</h1>
	<p>The temperature of urban areas  are  significantly higher than that of the surrounding  rural areas. This fact is known as the "Urban  Heat Island" effect.</p>
	<h2>Is this Global Warming?</h2>
	<p>No, this is a similar phenomenon  where cities are 6-8°F warmer than  surrounding rural areas. 
	Global warming  however could impact over large area ,not only concentrated in Urban areas.
	</p>
	<h2>Factors work to promote a heat island.</h2>
	<p>Concrete and man made surfaces
	Less water in the soil and environment
	Excess energy from buildings
	Excess waste generation
	Lack of Evapotranspiration
	locking of wind by tall Buildings
	Results of above points increase concentration of Ozone which results in temp. increment
	</p>
	<h2>Causes</h2>
	<p>materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties and surface radiative properties than the surrounding rural areas. This causes a change in the energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.</p>
	<p> Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration in urban areas.The U.S. Forest Service found in 2018 that cities in the United States are losing 36 million trees each year.With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and evaporative cooling effect of trees.</p>
	<p>Other causes of a UHI are due to geometric effects. The tall buildings within many urban areas provide multiple surfaces for the reflection and absorption of sunlight, increasing the efficiency with which urban areas are heated. This is called the "urban canyon effect".</p>
	<p> Another effect of buildings is the blocking of wind, which also inhibits cooling by convection and prevents pollutants from dissipating. Waste heat from automobiles, air conditioning, industry, and other sources also contributes to the UHI.High levels of pollution in urban areas can also increase the UHI, as many forms of pollution change the radiative properties of the atmosphere.UHI not only raises urban temperatures but also increases ozone concentrations because ozone is a greenhouse gas whose formation will accelerate with the increase of temperature.</p>
	<h2>Seasonal Behaviour</h2>
	<p>Due to the urban heat island effect temperature difference is not only usually larger at night than during the day, but also larger in winter than in summer. This is especially true in areas where snow is common, as cities tend to hold snow for shorter periods of time than surrounding rural areas .This decreases the albedo of the city and thereby magnifies the heating effect.</p> 
	<p>Higher wind speeds in rural areas, particularly in winter, can also function to make them cooler than urban areas. Regions with distinct wet and dry seasons will exhibit a larger urban heat island effect during the dry season. As a result, moist rural soils will cool slower than dry rural soils and act to minimize the nocturnal temperature difference between urban and rural regions.</p>
	<h2>impacts on animals</h2>
	<p>Species that are good at colonizing can utilize conditions provided by urban heat islands to thrive in regions outside of their normal range.</p>
	<p> With temperate climates, urban heat islands will extend the growing season, therefore altering breeding strategies of inhabiting species.This can be obsereved on water temperature.With the temperature of the nearby buildings sometimes reaching over 50 degrees different from the near-surface air temperature, precipitation will warm rapidly, causing runoff into nearby streams, lakes and rivers (or other bodies of water) to provide excessive thermal pollution. The increase in the thermal pollution has the ability to increase water temperature by 20 to 30 degrees. This increase will cause the fish species inhabiting the body of water to undergo thermal stress and shock due to the rapid change in temperature to their climate.</p>
	<p>It also altered natural selection process. Over time of living in urban habitats, they have adapted to thrive in warmer climates than in coolerThe presence of non-native species is heavily dependent on the amount of human activity.They make their homes using the shelter provided by the humans in the upper regions of homes, allowing for an influx in their populations due to added protection and reduced predator numbers.</p>
	
	<h2>Effects of UHI</h2>
	<p>The change in urban environments can cause  unwanted climatic events such as  storms, hurricanes, and floods. 
Warmer air can  hold more water and moisture, which results in  more precipitation. 
For every 1°F rise in air temp.,  moisture increases 3-4%. UHIs can increase temp. by 15°F, which  can increase atmospheric water vapor by more  than 50%.UHIs can bring  the health risk of heat waves  during the summer, like  breathing in olds , heat cramps, and heat  strokes.

Every 1°C increase in air temperature,  there is a 5-10% more demand  in electricity ,which increases the use of fossils fuels.
</p>
	<h2>mitigation</h2>
	<p>The temperature difference between urban areas and the surrounding suburban or rural areas can be as much as 5 °C (9.0 °F).Nearly 40 percent of that increase is due to the prevalence of dark roofs, with the remainder coming from dark-colored pavement and the declining presence of vegetation.</p>
	<p>The heat island effect can be counteracted slightly by using white or reflective materials to build houses, roofs, pavements, and roads, thus increasing the overall albedo of the city.
	Relative to remedying the other sources of the problem, replacing dark roofing requires the least amount of investment for the most immediate return.</p>
	<p>Using light-colored concrete has proven effective in reflecting.Paving with light-colored concrete, in addition to replacing asphalt with light-colored concrete, communities may be able to lower average temperatures.</p>
	<p>A second option is to increase the amount of well-watered vegetation.</p>
	<p>These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs.Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment.</p>
	<p>Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen.</p>
	<p>A hypothetical "cool communities" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3 °C (5 °F) after planting ten million trees, reroofing five million homes, and painting one-quarter of the roads.
	Mitigation strategies include:</p>
	<p><b>White roofs</b>: Painting rooftops white has become a common strategy to reduce the heat island effect. White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar emittance, increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring.</p>
	<p><b>Green roofs</b>: Green roofery is the practice of having vegetation on a roof; such as having trees or a garden. The plants that are on the roof increase the albedo and decrease the urban heat island effect.</p>
	<p><b>Planting trees in cities</b>: It is recommended to plant deciduous trees because they can provide many benefits such as more shade in the summer and not blocking warmth in winter.</p>
	<p><b>Green parking lots</b>: Green parking lots use surfaces other than asphalt and vegetation to limit the impact urban heat island effect.</p>
