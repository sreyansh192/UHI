	<h1>URBAN HEAT ISLAND</h1>
	<p>The temperature of urban areas  are  significantly higher than that of the surrounding  rural areas. This fact is known as the "Urban  Heat Island" effect.</p>
	<h2>Is this Global Warming?</h2>
	<p>No, this is a similar phenomenon  where cities are 6-8째F warmer than  surrounding rural areas. 
	Global warming  however could impact over large area ,not only concentrated in Urban areas.
	</p>
	<h2>Factors work to promote a heat island.</h2>
	<p>Concrete and man made surfaces
	Less water in the soil and environment
	Excess energy from buildings
	Excess waste generation
	Lack of Evapotranspiration
	locking of wind by tall Buildings
	Results of above points increase concentration of Ozone which results in temp. increment
	</p>
	<h2>Causes</h2>
	<p>materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties and surface radiative properties than the surrounding rural areas. This causes a change in the energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.</p>
	<p> Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration in urban areas.The U.S. Forest Service found in 2018 that cities in the United States are losing 36 million trees each year.With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and evaporative cooling effect of trees.</p>
	<p>Other causes of a UHI are due to geometric effects. The tall buildings within many urban areas provide multiple surfaces for the reflection and absorption of sunlight, increasing the efficiency with which urban areas are heated. This is called the "urban canyon effect".</p>
	<p> Another effect of buildings is the blocking of wind, which also inhibits cooling by convection and prevents pollutants from dissipating. Waste heat from automobiles, air conditioning, industry, and other sources also contributes to the UHI.High levels of pollution in urban areas can also increase the UHI, as many forms of pollution change the radiative properties of the atmosphere.UHI not only raises urban temperatures but also increases ozone concentrations because ozone is a greenhouse gas whose formation will accelerate with the increase of temperature.</p>
	<h2>Effects of UHI</h2>
	<p>The change in urban environments can cause  unwanted climatic events such as  storms, hurricanes, and floods. 
Warmer air can  hold more water and moisture, which results in  more precipitation. 
For every 1째F rise in air temp.,  moisture increases 3-4%. UHIs can increase temp. by 15째F, which  can increase atmospheric water vapor by more  than 50%.UHIs can bring  the health risk of heat waves  during the summer, like  breathing in olds , heat cramps, and heat  strokes.

Every 1째C increase in air temperature,  there is a 5-10% more demand  in electricity ,which increases the use of fossils fuels.
