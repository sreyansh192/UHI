	<h2>What is Urban Heat Island effect??</h2>
	<p>The temperature of urban areas  are  significantly higher than that of the surrounding  rural areas. This fact is known as the "Urban  Heat Island" effect.</p>
	<h2>Is this Global Warming?</h2>
	<p>No, this is a similar phenomenon  where cities are 6-8째F warmer than  surrounding rural areas. 
	Global warming  however could impact over large area ,not only concentrated in Urban areas.
	</p>
	<h2>Factors work to promote a heat island.</h2>
	<p>Concrete and man made surfaces
	Less water in the soil and environment
	Excess energy from buildings
	Excess waste generation
	Lack of Evapotranspiration
	locking of wind by tall Buildings
	Results of above points increase concentration of Ozone which results in temp. increment
	</p>
	<h2>Causes</h2>
	<p>The main cause of the UHI effect modification of land surfaces, and  materials that effectively store short-  wave radiation.
	Blocking of winds by tall buildings.
	Waste heat generated by energy  usage is a secondary contributor factories.
	During the day in rural areas  evaporation and evapotranspiration causes cooling.
	In cities,large solar energy are absorbed by the concrete structures.
	UHIs have been indirectly related to all climatic change and greenhouse effect.
	Night are warmer in urban because of radiation from block surfaces in atmosphere.
	Tar, asphalt, brick and concrete are main absorber and radiator unlike soil.
	</p>
	<h2>Effects of UHI</h2>
	<p>The change in urban environments can cause  unwanted climatic events such as  storms, hurricanes, and floods. 
Warmer air can  hold more water and moisture, which results in  more precipitation. 
For every 1째F rise in air temp.,  moisture increases 3-4%. UHIs can increase temp. by 15째F, which  can increase atmospheric water vapor by more  than 50%.UHIs can bring  the health risk of heat waves  during the summer, like  breathing in olds , heat cramps, and heat  strokes.

Every 1째C increase in air temperature,  there is a 5-10% more demand  in electricity ,which increases the use of fossils fuels.
